# Android webview example

This code is working from API 21

Usage
-----

To enable the tint:

```java
mWebView.loadUrl("https://www.google.com/");
```

Change the url, it also work for local file as well.

```java
mWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/index.html");
```

It works also to enable the caching for web view. Using LOAD_DEFAULT property, it works in offline mode also.
